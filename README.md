# Lunchtime

### Welcome to Lunchtime! An iOS application to help you find the closest restaurants near you.

**In order to successfully run the app while adhering to good security practices - a Google places API key is not hardcoded and will be needed. The app will look for the API_KEY variable in a xcconfig file which is NOT provided.**

The line should read:
```
API_KEY = {Google Places(new) API key} 
```
